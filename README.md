## Monte Carlo method to a special kind of 1D Ising model
This program aims to apply simple Monte Carlo method to solve a special kind of Ising model with the ext-nearest-neighbor interactions. The traditional Ising model only consists of the nearest neighbor interactions, and it can be dividied into 2 types: ferromagnetic model and antiferromagnetic model. In the program, you can set J_2 = 0 to realize the general ferromagnetic model and antiferromagnetic models. Changing J_2, you will see a critical point in very low temperature (nearly zero), which is a special property not shown in 1D Ising models.
